# User-Script: Always Show Spoilers for Pawoo

This is a GreaseMonkey-compatible user-script that reveals spoilers on the Pawoo website automatically.  It should work with all parts of the site, both the main deck-style application and when browsing individual profiles and toots.

Toots that were automatically revealed will have a red-tint behind them.

## Installation

Just grab `userscript.js` and load it into a GreaseMonkey compatible user-script browser extension.

Many of these extensions can detect a user-script when viewing a JavaScript file on Github that has a GreaseMonkey header, so just viewing the raw file here may allow you to import it with a simple click of a button.

As always, **be sure to inspect the source code of any user-script you are interested in before installing it** to ensure it does nothing malicious.  Do it with this script, other scripts, all scripts!

## Browser Compatibility

This script makes use of some modern browser features, so may not work with older browsers.

Specific features used:
* The ES6 `class` keyword
* Static class methods
* Rest-parameters for functions
* Spread-syntax for array literals
* The `for-of` loop
* The `Set` built-in class
* The `MutationObserver` built-in class
* Arrow functions
* String template literals
* CSS3's `::before` syntax

Almost all modern browsers now support these features.
